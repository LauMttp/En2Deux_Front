## What is En2Deux

A collaborative work with Laurent M. and Agash J. made for the Final project of Ironhack. 

For those who have organized events with their friends, family or collegues,
We know how much it is a struggle to make sure you satisfy everyone's demands.
They never have the same plannings or budgets, some take a long time to answer ...etc ðŸ¤¯

Thus, that is exactly why we created En2Deux !

## User Experience
User1 creates an event, he fills the different options.
Then he invites friends to join event and they'll vote for the best option.
